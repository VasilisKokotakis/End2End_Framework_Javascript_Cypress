# End-to-End Testing Framework with JavaScript and Cypress

Welcome to the repository for my comprehensive End-to-End Testing Framework, developed using JavaScript and Cypress. This framework is designed to streamline the testing process, ensuring thorough examination of web pages while leveraging Behavior Driven Development (BDD) testing principles.

## Key Features:

- **JavaScript + Cypress:** The framework is built on the powerful combination of JavaScript and Cypress, providing a robust and efficient testing environment.

- **Behavior Driven Development (BDD):** Embrace a structured approach to testing by implementing BDD principles. This methodology enhances collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders.

- **Webpage Testing:** Conduct thorough testing of webpages to validate functionality, performance, and user experience. This framework enables meticulous exploration of every aspect of your web application.

- **Locator Strategies:** Discover effective locator strategies to precisely identify and interact with elements on the webpage. Accurate locators are crucial for reliable and maintainable tests.

- **Reporting:** Generate comprehensive reports to track test results and identify issues. Clear and detailed reporting ensures easy identification of problem areas and accelerates the debugging process.

- **Issue Identification:** Uncover and document all problems within the website during testing. By systematically identifying and reporting issues, this framework contributes to the overall improvement of web application quality.
